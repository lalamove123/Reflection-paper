            The production staff behind this event genuinely amazes me. To say I'm impressed would be a huge understatement. The Q&A portion was my favorite part of the presentation, even if it started off a little slowly. I realized how important cyber knowledge and data privacy are during this part when I stood up to respond to the speaker's question. We gained knowledge about the many data privacy regulations that are in place, their purposes, and how they shield us from cybercriminals, hackers, and data thieves. Protecting users from those who try to misuse or steal data requires these regulations. These cybercriminals often face prison terms of six years or longer, depending on how serious their offenses were.

            I was quite impressed by the speaker's delivery. I was captivated by his lucid and captivating manner during the whole session. He underlined how risky using the internet may be, especially because there are those ready to do damage in the shadows. He did, however, also reassure us that there are steps we may take to stay out of trouble. He emphasized the need of cyber governance, emphasizing that cyber authorities serve as our first line of defense, assist in recovering lost data, and raise public knowledge of the risks that might arise when using the internet. It is our duty to be conscious that the everyday internet-connected items we use, like our computers and phones, are portals to both opportunity and risk.

            The entire campaign was really enjoyable for me. We learned how to use our gadgets responsibly and successfully from the team when it came to accessing the internet. There were moments when the mood was playful, which added to the enjoyment of studying. Realizing that a hacker's acts may have an international influence even if they operate out of a foreign nation was one of the most important lessons I learned.
